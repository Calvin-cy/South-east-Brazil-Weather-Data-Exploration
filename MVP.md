## MVP

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, and try to predict the future temperture

The dataset is raw, so I will pre-process the data by cleaning up the data and filling up the missing values by using educated assumptions

Here is the average temperature of each station from the South-East area of Brazil, 
I will try to find more insights from the dataset, and apply different machine learning algorithms to predict the future temperature
